## Data Source

The Datasets used is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. The dataset are made available through Mobius.

The dataset are generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 and 12 May 2016.

There are 18 csv files and we will be using the files named below:

dailyActivity_merged.csv\
hourlyCalories_merged.csv\
hourlyIntensities_merged.csv\
hourlySteps_merged.csv\
sleepDay_merged.csv

I have converted the date column of each csv to a compactable format before importing to the sql database.

The sample size of the data is small (30 users) and the data is from 6 years ago, the dataset cannot represent the current population. The case study will only base on the 30 users at the time they took the survey.

## Data Analyze
The data will be process and analyze through [sql](Bellabeat_Query.sql).
